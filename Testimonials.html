                           Shortly after partnering with Robin and his agency, a hailstorm required our entire roof to be replaced ($70,000). Without hesitation, a check was cut to cover our entire cost. Since then, we experienced another significant claim with the same result. When it comes to service and Robin’s response time, “Wow” comes to mind. <strong>Service to us has been more than words on a business card. </strong>His actions confirm it is a priority. We have also benefited from numerous risk management resources including the legal assistance service (free). Thanks for all you do (Robin and Sue) for churches so we can focus on our ministry as you carry out your mission.  If your ministry has never pursued a quote through Robin’s agency, I recommend you proceed. We benefited in a significant way by doing the same.

                           Ministry specific coverage has always been important to us. We like the fact that Robin is full time with his emphasis on partnering with ministries. He has demonstrated that he is <strong>a specialized agent in this field of insurance.</strong> In our case, their premium was/is competitive and offered better coverage than our previous carrier.  Robin’s response to claims has been prompt and fair. He understands ministry, the exposures which go along with that, and has consistently demonstrated a concern for our ministry.  He stays in touch and has<strong> demonstrated the highest degree of integrity.</strong>  His personal concern for the effectiveness of our ministry has also been quite clear. He and his office have been helpful on numerous occasions. I'm happy for the occasion of recommending Robin Pickett and his agency.
